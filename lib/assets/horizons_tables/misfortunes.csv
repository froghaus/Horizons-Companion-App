Blinded Eye,"It had been an accident. Just a moment of lapsed concentration, and the blade has raked his skin from cheek to hairline.

Chronic Illness/Pain,"Mona had only been a child when it had started, and so she had simply thought for some time that this was how life was for everyone.

Disfigured Appearance,"The eye is naturally drawn to the face, searching for telltales of emotions in the eyes and lips.

Hard of Hearing,Leo had come out of the blast seemingly unscathed -- a miracle given the chemister’s charred remains -- but the ringing he heard in its wake never truly left his ears.,"Your hearing is impaired, perhaps by injury, natural causes, or an audio processing disorder.

Impropriety,"Shyla always knew she came across brusk.

Injured Back,"The post-calamity warlord, Jen Grim-Brow, once dominated the roads and lands within a hundred miles of Old Providence. Her fall from power came quite literally in a fall from her saddle, forced to conquer from the seat of a cart instead.","Your back has some form of skeletal or muscular damage or deformity.

Mark of Scorn,"The searing pain of the brand had seemed like the apex of his life’s agonies, yet it faded into memory with time.

Outsider,"Eloise did not need to make introductions upon stepping into the tavern. The patrons could tell by her furs that she was a northerner, a skinning knife at her hip and a shoulder pelt branded with the Kebeck Cross.

Reputation for Cruelty,"Spattered with blood and panting heavily, she waited until the last of the bandits had fled from sight, then turned back to the young merchant who had been their mark.//“It’s alright,” she said. “They’re gone now.”//“Please!” he cried, tripping over himself as he tried to tear the rings from his finger to throw at her feet. “Just take it! Please don’t hurt me!”//Raleigh the Red sighed, frowning to herself as she put away the sword.","Your name carries with it a reputation of cruelty, whether you have earned it or not.

Weird-Touched,"He awoke in the wood, standing upright, his bedclothes torn and pierced with brambles. His heart seized with fright, his eyes searching for an explanation before at last turning skyward to fight the night sky dancing with ribbons of light.
