Alcoholic,"Lorelei had led the charge on Amherst Keep, dined with the young Warlord of Old Boston in his own hall, lived to see her name known and feared. Now she lay face-down in a ditch, her sword pawned and flask empty, muttering to herself. “A drink. A drink. A drink…”","You exhibit the symptoms of alcoholism, prone to trembling and rage when away from its effects for too long.

Addicted to [Substance],The surgeon gave him all manner of things to cope with the pain after his fall. A brace kept the bone place. The poultice reduced the swelling.

Agoraphobic,"Taran didn’t understand how anyone could live in town, let alone the cities. On the few trips he made to market to sell hunted game, he swore he could feel the pressure of everyone staring at him, looking down on him and waiting for him to mess up. He swore to himself he wouldn’t let it get to him, but still he could feel the stress mounting in the nape of his neck.","Whenever possible, you avoid crowded and well trafficked spaces.

Battle Trauma,"At the end of the warring era, Anders found himself wealthy from loot and without a warlord master. He retired to a farmstead with his husband, where he put his earnings to work and made a modest living, free from the violence of his youth. Free, save for the trembling and the short temper, and the terror-filled dreams which visited him nightly.","When in the presence of violence or combat, you tense up and feel your hands begin to shake.

Bloodlust,"She had only meant to beat back the bandit, or perhaps teach him a lesson, but the hatchet had come down harder than she intended. Something in the crack reverberating through the handle felt good. Felt right. So she wrenched it free and tried again. Only once at first, and then again. And again. And again.","When steeped in the heat of battle, you find yourself unable to control yourself or your aggression.

Claustrophobic,"Barry knew full well how the neglected cities had become like this, the urban decay submerging into shifting topsoil as the pavers cracked and wood rotted. Still, knowing the why of it didn’t make having to crawl through so many tight tunnels to find scrap didn’t make it any easier.","Wherever possible, you avoid tight and enclosed spaces, fearing that you may become trapped or stuck.

"
Cynical,"Edmund didn’t see why everyone was so eager to try the solar heater. Boiling water over the hearth had never failed to work before, and bringing all that tech and copper wiring into the home could hardly be natural. Effective, perhaps, but he just knew that shit was dangerous. Hardly worth the risk of switching.","When faced with a novel or unconventional idea, such as a new application of technology or a new method of medicine, you always come up with some reason why it will fail or be counterproductive, and must be convinced otherwise first.","When you take an unconventional approach to something or go along with a new method, the GM may invoke this anxiety to have you take 3 stress. "
Fear of Death,"As the hail of lead and crossbow bolts rained down upon them, the man beside him crumpling in a twitching heap, Levar could not help but take notice of how much more enjoyable the tales and songs had made battle seem. He watched the man convulse and spew blood a few moments more, then turned his back and fled, his heart pounding in his ears.","Unless highly motivated to do so, you will never voluntarily take an action which could cost you your life for any reason. If there remains a chance of survival, you must take it.","Whenever you are put in a situation where you could potentially face death, or when you witness the death of another, the GM may invoke this anxiety to have you take 3 stress."
Greed,"Cora grunted with each step, pain shooting up her side. The sweat and blood had mixed together on her brow, dripping over her chin and from the cut on her arm, leaving a trail of spatters behind her. Still, she clung to the sack of silver, the weight of it seeming to bear down heavier and heavier the longer she went on, but she dared not drop it. This was her prize. This was what she had killed for, and she was not going to leave it behind. ","You covet wealth and valuable possessions.

Impatience,"They had found the entrance to the rumored bunker, but its steel-plate doors were still fastened shut by old-world tech. Francis would have much preferred they stay a while and try a few more incendiary solutions, but the others insisted they return to the university and research the lock. Sit there in silence, over dusty books, while the timepiece counted the slow seconds with its interminable ticking. Madness.","You struggle to repress yourself, and feel a palpable discomfort when forced to wait or act slowly. When given the choice to seize an opportunity or wait for a better moment, you always favor the former.","Whenever you are forced to wait, choose to take a patient approach, or take an action which requires patience, the GM may invoke this anxiety to have you take 3 stress."
Incorrigible Flirt,"Out she went through the window. The breeze chilling her bare skin and whistling in her ears. Sounds of shouting behind her fast-fading as the dirt rose to meet her. She tumbled as she hit the ground, springing back to her feet and tearing off into the night, doing her best to keep the bedsheet pulled up around her. Buck naked, full of adrenaline, and hoping the mayor’s husband hadn’t seen her face, she swore this would be the last time. Just as she had the last time she had found herself in this position. ","You find it difficult to pass up a chance to flirt with anyone you find attractive, and likewise cannot help but return flirtatious advances from someone you find attractive.","After you attempt to make your flirtations subtle, to ignore advances, or lie in the face of the social consequences of your flirtation, the GM may invoke this anxiety to have you take 3 stress."
Merciless,"As the heat of the spreading blaze pricked at her face, her eyes watching the incandescent shapes of the bandit camp blacken and crumble, Nadiya felt nothing. Not pride, nor regret for the blood which still dripped from her fingers. They had deserved it, and this was simply what had needed doing.

Paranoia,"In the gloom of dusk, Shannon could only see the dark silhouettes of broken-down breams and overgrowth trees, but she knew they were in there somewhere. She had seen the hooded figures out there in the urban decay, and they had seen her watching. Chased after her, and were following her still even a year later. Her eyelids drooped from exhaustion, but she remained steadfast over her cup of tea. No cultist would be sneaking up on her tonight.","You see enemies in every shadow, or perhaps you see deception in every smile. Work with your GM to determine the specifics of your paranoia.

Self Importance,"Saskia was destined for greatness. This she had known ever since childhood, excelling in all forms from combat to art, and being sent to the University to learn from the great masters. That was her blessing, and her curse in turn was the common folk, whose base affections and opinions only ever served to exhaust her precious time and energy.","You believe you are destined for great things, perhaps due to your upbringing, or just subject to delusions of grandeur.

Social Anxiety,"Geoffrey hated the mess hall. He hated having no exit to a conversation, he hated the smacking sound the other guards’ mouths made, but most of all, he hated that he wanted to be there. Hated that he wanted to join in on the laughter and the story telling, but could never find a way to get even a single word in.","Work with your GM to determine the extent of this anxiety, ranging from general meekness, to shyness, to locking up in social situations.

Softhearted,"Hassan threw down his blade, landing with a clatter on the ancient concrete. The bloodied warlord, hunched double before him, stared down at the blade in confusion, then began to laugh. Here was the woman who had killed his mother, burned his village and taken his peaceful life away from him, and he could not even bring himself to strike her down.","You cannot bring yourself to kill another person, no matter how terrible you perceive them as being. You never kill a character when you reduce them to 0 health.","Whenever you take part in the death of a character, seriously injure another person, or help reduce a character to 0 health, the GM may invoke this anxiety to have you take 3 stress.

As the dust settled, what was normal and what was to be feared also began to fall into place.","You harbor deep suspicions of anything supernatural or seemingly supernatural, and become visibly agitated in the presence thereof. You might rely on folklore to stave it off, distance yourself as quickly as possible, or react violently.","After interacting with or being affected by something supernatural, the GM may invoke this anxiety to have you take 3 stress."
