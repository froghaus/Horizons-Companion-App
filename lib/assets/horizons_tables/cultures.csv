Scholarly Cloister,Convincing//Intuitive//Studious//Tactile,"So much knowledge was lost in the wake of the Calamity, but there were many who did their utmost to preserve what information they could. Small settlements gradually took form around these places of learning as others came to contribute their own finds and discoveries. Universities, monasteries, workshops, hermitages. Regardless of the kind of knowledge sought, there is a place for its scholars to retreat from the outside world, where they can study, meditate, and speak with others to deepen their understanding.//You were raised in such a place, or perhaps you came later in life and made it your new home. You see the pursuit and preservation of knowledge as inherently virtuous, though you might consider some more worthy of access to that knowledge than others."
Pastoral Country,Athletic//Intuitive//Rugged//Tactile,"While the Calamity upended life in every corner of civilization, those already equipped with the tools to live off the land were the quickest to get back on their feet. This is not to say the farmers and shepherds had it easy. The hardships they had always faced, drought and blight, were now joined by scarce trade and looters. Under-armed and under supplied, the community became the tool and weapon of choice among the rural farmsteads, joining together in small townships and communes to pool resources and know-how, raising both walls and barns, smithing both plows and blades.//You were raised in such a place, or perhaps you settled there after a life of wandering. You know firsthand the power and importance of community, and have been instilled with a culture of putting the group above the individual, though who you think truly belongs in the group depends on what sort of community you come from."
Privileged Position,Convincing//Graceful//Intuitive//Subtle,"The delicate arrangement of social rules and obligations, the scaffolding of hierarchy, was not built to endure the Calamity. Power structures collapsed, and at least for a time, the gap between the meek and the powerful was bridged in shared loss. Some fought to keep it that way, but there are always a select few who will figure out the trick of exploiting the labor and surplus of others.//Thus did the stratification of society begin anew. The names and the faces changed, but the idea remained the same: rules and customs to channel wealth from the many into the hands of a few, backed by consent at best, and the promise of coercive violence at worst.//You were raised into such a position, or perhaps ascended to it through work, luck, or the efforts of others. You command an air of respect among those familiar with your influence, but others regard you with disdain."
Nomadic Travelers,Convincing//Graceful//Rugged//Tactile,"In the wake of the calamity, many groups had no choice but to become nomadic by default. The places they came from were rendered uninhabitable, and such places holding onto shreds of normalcy often closed their gates to the desperate. They were set adrift, but in wandering, they found what many cultures long before them had also discovered. That there is power and freedom in untethering oneâ€™s self from one location, and with the collapse of land ownership, the common lands and wilds provided more than enough for all their children.//You were raised among such people, or joined them when their caravan rolled through, or perhaps set off on your own. You value the freedom of your culture and lifestyle, and see the right to travel and move as inalienable. You despise chains that bind, both physical and otherwise, though what you consider to be chains might differ greatly from the views of others."
Warrior Culture,Combat//Expressive//Tactile//Athletic,"Nearly all complex societies, especially those on a larger scale, enforce their rules and power structures through a liberal application of a coercive force. The simplest and most common form of these is raw violence, though its use is often dressed up in the guise of law enforcement, and cloaked in the language of righteousness. In the time following the calamity, the only thing which changed was the number of entities practicing coercive violence, and the language they used to justify it.//City-state armies, warlord raiding parties, militant monastics. There are all manner of groups who take up arms, and just as many reasons for doing so, but they all do it out of need. Violence as a way of life is necessarily taxing, and so noble causes and codes of honor govern those who would take up arms against any who would try to impose force in turn.//You were raised among such people, or enlisted out of need or coercion. You see the violence you were taught to use as a necessary tool, though your relationship with the code of honor or righteous cause of your people might be more complex."
Port Society,Rugged//Expressive//Perceptive//Athletic,"In an age of structural and societal collapse, there are few resources more important than water. The water is necessary for life. It turns the wheels of mills and carries ships of passengers to their destination. The water provides food and salt and a way of life, and in the wake of the calamity, many found themselves called to it. What trade remains almost always passes through the settlements they made, and folks of all stripes pass through with them, mingling with hardy mariners and well-dressed merchants. Each brings with them new ideas and customs, and each transforms the culture just a little more.//Yet every place of abundance casts a shadow of danger. Where there is plenty, there will be those who desire to make the surplus their own, be it with steel or carefully chosen words. More than anywhere else, the large coastal settlements resemble the old world before its collapse, for better and worse.//You were raised in such a place, or spent much of your time passing through places like it. You see a diversity of thoughts and ideas as a strength to be valued, and might be more inclined to incorporate new ways and methods into your work than others."
Urban Hub,Subtle//Intuitive//Tactile//Athletic,"The cities were perhaps those hit hardest by the calamity, having the most mouths to feed and being the most dependent on stable trade. Population flight, structural collapse, and technological failure created a series of cascading disasters, and the once teeming hubs of society became desolate ghost towns.//Now, in the aftermath, the ruined cities provide a new allure for those who survive. The treasures of the old world lay in wait for those willing to brave the danger -- scrap from old tech, salvaged materials from buildings, precious metals from abandoned belongings. As scrapping becomes a profession, the ruins of old are transformed into new urban hubs, serving as base and trading post for the thriving markets. These new cities are small compared to those of the past, more akin to walled city squares than the ruins surrounding them, but displaying all the same features on a diminutive scale. An echo of the old world, feeding off its remains.//You were raised in such a place, or perhaps moved to one for work. To you, the world outside the city hubs seems a terribly dangerous and chaotic place, and you prefer the predictability of civilization. You see value in the ideals of an ordered society, though you may disagree on what should be made law, and how it should be enforced."
